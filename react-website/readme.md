# React App

# Misc Notes
 - So far there's nothing to check if elements are overlapping, since they're all independent of each other
 - One idea might be to store a 2D array that adds the elements like a bitmap just to check

# Files

## `src/` ##

- **`App.js`** - Contains the React code for the main page of the website

- **`index.js`** - The code for actually initialising the React app; `App.js` is the scene loaded by this

- **`LayoutGrid.js`**
    - The class for the abstract grid
	- Given the .json layout, generates the grid of `TaskButton` elements with the given parameters

- **`TaskButton.js`**
	- Simple element that just takes an x, y, width, height and name and places itself on the LayoutGrid 


### Misc/Can ignore

**package.json**
 - The configuration for the node package
 - Defines scripts that allow you to run, build and test the app that you can run using `npm <script>`
 - Also allows you to make the app more portable by listing dependencies for npm to install rather than uploading the actual files to github
 - **package-lock.json** is used for tying dependencies to a specific version

**Testing/Analytics**
 - `src/App.test.js`, `src/reportWebVitals.js` and `src/setupTests.js` are all autogenerated by create-react-app for testing
