# **IPSOS:** A Self Learning Application
## Project Brief 

* The idea is to have a self-learning algorithm that will move elements on a webpage to optimize user experience by reducing time spent on a page to complete a goal 

* To prove this concept, we will create an abstract website, with buttons laid out on a grid 

* The aim is for the user to complete “goals” by pressing a series of buttons in sequence (e.g. sign in -> account options -> add card) 

* The website will begin with buttons randomly laid out, users then complete goals either through real-life users, or using Selenium in order to simulate inputs 

* The RL model is then fed a constant stream of user input data, and how long it took to complete a goal for the current layout. Through an evolutionary process it will attempt to optimise the layout to reduce the time taken to complete goals.
